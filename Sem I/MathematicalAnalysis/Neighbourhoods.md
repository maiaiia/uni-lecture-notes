## Def 
- a set $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ is a **neighbourhood** of $x \in \mathbb{R}$ if $$\exists \epsilon > 0: (x - \epsilon, x + \epsilon) \subseteq V$$
- the **interior** of $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$: $int(A) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} | \exists V \in \mathcal{V}(x) : V \subseteq A\}$      
- the **closure** of $A \subseteq \mathbb{R}$: $cl(A) = \{x \in \mathbb{R} | \forall V \in \mathcal{V}(x), V \cap A \neq \emptyset\}$      
- if $A = int(A), A$ is called *open*
- if $A = cl(A), A$ is called *closed*

## Theorems
- $int(A) \subseteq A \subseteq cl(A)$
>[!tip] the theorem above
- the complement of an open set is closed
- the complement of a closed set is open 
- any union of open sets is open
- any intersection of closed sets is closed 
- any finite intersection of open sets is open
- any finite union of closed sets is closed 

>[!important] remember to study the proofs of the theorems above
