## Def - Elementary operations
$\epsilon_{ij} = $ 


## Eqiuvalent lists of vectors  
Two lists $X$ and $X'$ in the vector space $V^n$ over $K$ are *equivalent* if one of them can be obtained from the other by applying a finite number of elementary operations $\phi:V^n\rightarrow V^n : \phi(X) = X'$

### Theorems 
- $X$ is linearly independent in $V^n \iff X'$ is linearly independent in $V^n$
- X is a system of generators for $V^n \iff X'$ is a system of generators for $V^n$
