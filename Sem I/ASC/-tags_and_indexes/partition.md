## Def
A partition is a family of pairwise disjoint non-empty subsets of an original set $A$, which cover the whole set A
In a more mathematical sense:
$(A_i)_{i \in I}$ is a partition of $A$ if both
1. $\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i = A$ 
2. $\forall i,j \in I, i \neq j \Rightarrow A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$  
are true
