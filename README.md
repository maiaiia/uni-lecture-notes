# uni-lecture-notes
An Obsidian vault containing all the lecture notes I've taken during my bachelor's degree in CS at BBU Cluj.
## How to use this repo
For swift navigation between files a nd seamless rendering of the attachments (especially those created with Excalidraw), I highly recommend using Obsidian. Simply move the contents of this repo into a local directory, open it as an Obsidian vault, then follow the steps below:
## Recommended Settings 
### Essential
- Install and enable Excalidraw plugin (Settings -> Community plugins -> Browse)
- Install and enable Tabs plugin (obsidian://show-plugin?id=tabs)
### Personal preferences 
#### General
- Theme: Tokyo Night (Settings -> Appearance -> Themes)
- disable inline title (Settings -> Appearance -> Show inline title)
#### Graphic view
- hide all folders starting with underscores (Settings -> Files and links -> Excluded files)
- hide orphan files (Open graph view -> Settings -> Filters -> Orphans)
- hide attachments (these are already stored in their corresponding \_attachments files (hidden), but just in case) (Open graph view ->  Settings -> Filters -> Attachments)
- show existing files only (Open graph view -> Settings -> Filters -> Existing files only)
- create groups for each semester / subject / whichever criteria makes sense to you
