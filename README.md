# uni-lecture-notes
An Obsidian vault containing all the lecture notes I've taken during my bachelor's degree in CS at BBU Cluj
## How to use this repo
For both a swift navigation between files and rendering the attachments (especially those made using Excalidraw), I highly recommend using Obsidian. Just move the contents of this repo in a local folder and open it as an Obsidian vault, then follow the steps below.
## Recommended Settings 
### Essential
- Install and enable Excalidraw plugin (Settings -> Community plugins -> Browse)
### Personal preferences 
- Theme: Tokyo Night (Settings -> Appearance -> Themes)
- disable inline title (Settings -> Appearance -> Show inline title)
#### Graphic view
- hide all folders starting with underscores (Settings -> Files and links -> Excluded files)
- hide orphan files (Open graph view -> Settings -> Filters -> Orphans)
- hide attachments (these are already stored in their corresponding \_attachments files (hidden), but just in case) (Open graph view ->  Settings -> Filters -> Attachments)
- show existing files only (Open graph view -> Settings -> Filters -> Existing files only)
