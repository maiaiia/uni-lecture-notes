# uni-lecture-notes
An Obsidian vault containing all the lecture notes I've taken during my bachelor's degree in CS at BBU Cluj.
## Recommended Settings 
For swift navigation between files and seamless rendering of the attachments (especially those created using Excalidraw), I highly recommend using Obsidian. Simply move the contents of this repo into a local directory, open it as an Obsidian vault, then follow the steps below:
### Essential
- Install and enable [Excalidraw](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-excalidraw-plugin) plugin
- Install and enable [Tabs](obsidian://show-plugin?id=tabs) plugin
### Personal preferences 
#### General
- Theme: Tokyo Night (Settings -> Appearance -> Themes)
- disable inline title (Settings -> Appearance -> Show inline title)
- Install and enable [Image Toolkit](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-image-toolkit) plugin
#### Graphic view
- declutter
	- hide attachments
		- go to Settings -> Files and links -> Excluded files
		- add the following REGEXs (individually): `/overview/`, `/_excalidraw/`, `/_attachments/` 
	- hide orphan files (Open graph view -> Settings -> Filters -> Orphans)
	- show existing files only (Open graph view -> Settings -> Filters -> Existing files only)
- create groups for each semester / subject / whichever criteria makes sense to you
