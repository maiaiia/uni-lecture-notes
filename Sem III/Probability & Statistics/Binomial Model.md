Binomial Model:

This model is used when the trials of an experiment satisfy three conditions:
1. they are independent
2. each trial has only two possible outcomes, which we refer to as "success" ($A$) and "failure" ($\bar{A}$)
3. the probability of success $p = P(A)$ is the same for each trial (we denote by $q = 1-p = P(\bar{A})$) the probability of failure

>[!Info]
>The probability $P(n;k)$ is the coefficient of $x^k$ in the Binomial expansion, hence the name of the model

>[!Tip]
>The trials in a Binomial Model are also known as Bernoulli trials.
