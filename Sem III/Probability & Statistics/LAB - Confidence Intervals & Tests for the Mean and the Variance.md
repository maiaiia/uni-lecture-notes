# LAB - Confidence Intervals & Tests for the Mean and the Variance

$X$ is a population
$\theta$ (unknown, target parameter) is a characteristic of $X$ (mean, std, variance)

We can analyse just a sample of a population to determine an estimate of the true value of $\theta$.

One method of doing so is using **Confidence intervals**.

>[!Definition] Confidence intervals
>$$P(\theta \in (\theta_L, \theta_U)) = 1 - \alpha,$$
>where 
>- $1 - \alpha$ is the *confidence level*
>- $\alpha$ is the *significance level* (error; usually should be at most 5%)
>- $(\theta_L, \theta_U)$ is the ($100(1-\alpha)$) *confidence interval*
>

e.g. $P(\mu \in (160, 180)) = 99\%$

>[!Important]
>Note that confidence intervals are **not
