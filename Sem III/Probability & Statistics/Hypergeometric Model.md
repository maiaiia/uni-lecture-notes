The version of the [[Binomial Model]], **without replacement**.

>[!Info] Model
>There are $N$ objects, $n_1$ of which have a certain trait ("success"). A number of $n$ objects are selected, one at a time, **without replacement**. Find the probability $P(n, k)$ of exactly $k$ of the $n$ objects selected having that trait (i.e. $k$ successes).
>$$P(n,k) = \cfrac{C_{n_1}^k \cdot C_{N-n_1}^{n-k}}{C_N^n}$$
