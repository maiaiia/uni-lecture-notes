## Lab 4
1.a. Write a function to return the n-th element of a list, or NIL if such an element does not exist.
1.b. Write a function to check whether an atom E is a member of a list which is not necessarily linear
1.c. Write a function to determine the list of all sublists of a given list, on any level. A sublist is either the list itself, or any element that is a list, at any level.
1.d. Write a function to transform a linear list into a set


2.a. Write a function to return the product of two vectors
2.b. Write a function to return the depth of a list
2.c. Write a function to sort a linear list without keeping the double values
2.d. Write a function to return the intersection of two sets


3.a. Write a function that inserts in a linear list a given atom A after the 2nd, 4th, 6th, ... element
3.b. Write a function that returns all atoms in a given list, in reverse order (e.g. (((A B C) D) E) returns (E D C B A))
3.c. Write a function that returns the greatest common divisor of all numbers in a non-linear list 
3.d. Write a function that determines the number of occurrences of a given atom in 
a non-linear list


4.a. Write a function to return the sum of two vectors
4.b. Write a function that returns all atoms in a given list, maintaining the order (3.b. same order)
4.c. Write a function that inverts continuous sequences of atoms in a given list (e.g. (a b c (d (e f) g h i)) returns (c b a (d (f e) i h g)) )
4.d.  Write a function that returns the maximum value of the numerical atoms from a list, at the superficial level (i'm assuming the atoms in the main list?)


5.a. Write the n-th element of a linear list twice (e.g. (10 20 30 40 50) and n = 3 will return (10 20 30 30 40 50))
5.b. Write a function to return the association (?) of two vectors (e.g. (A B C) x (X Y Z) returns ((A, X) (B, Y) (C Z))
5.c. Write a function to determine the number of sublists in a given list, on any level (e.g. (1 2 (3 (4 5) (6 7)) 8 (9 10)) will return 5)
5.d. Write a function that returns the number of all numerical atoms in a list at level 0.


6.a. Write a function to test wether a list is linear
6.b. Write a function to replace the first occurrence of an element E in a given list with another element O
6.c. Write a function to replace each sublist of a list with its last atomic element

7.a. Write a function to eliminate the n-th element of a linear list
7.b. Write a function to determine the successor of a number represented digit by digit as a list, without transforming the representation of the number from list to number.
7.c. Write a function to return the set of all atoms in a non-linear list (no duplicate values)
7.d. Write a function to test whether a linear list is a set


8.a. Write a function to return the difference of two sets
8.b. Write a function to reverse a list with all its sublists, on all levels
8.c. Write a function that returns a list of the first elements in each list that has an odd number of elements (both atoms and sublists)
8.d. Write a function to return the sum of all numerical atoms in a list at the superficial level

9.a. Write a function that merges two sorted linear lists and keeps duplicates
9.b. Write a function that replaces an element E with all the elements of a list L1 in a given list L
9.c. Write a function that determines the sum of two numbers in a list representation, and returns the corresponding decimal number, without transforming the representation of the number from list to number
9.d. Write a function that returns the gcd of all numbers in a linear list


10.a. Write a function that returns the product of all the numerical atoms from a list, at superficial level
10.b. Write a function that replaces the first occurrence of an element E in a given list with another element O 
10.c. Write a function that computes the result of an arithmetic expression memorised in preorder on a stack
10.d. Write a function that produces the list of pairs (atom n), where atom appears n times in a linear list (e.g. (A B A B A C A) returns ((A 3) (B 2) (C 1)))


11.a. Determine the lcm of the numerical values in a non-linear list 
11.b. Write a function to test if a linear list of numbers is a "mountain"
11.c. Remove all occurrences of the maximum numerical element from a non-linear list

12.a. Write a function that returns the dot product of two vectors 
12.b. Write a function that returns the maximum value of all the numerical atoms in a list, at any level
12.c. same as 10.c.
12.d. Write a function that returns T if a list has an even number of elements on the first level, and NIL otherwise (do it without counting the elements of the list)


13.a. A linear list and a number N are given. Remove the Nth, 2\*Nth, etc. element
13.b. Write a function to test if a linear list of integer numbers has a "valley" aspect. A list must have at least 3 elements to fulfil this condition 
13.c. Write a function that returns the minimum numeric atom from a list, at any level
13.d. Write a function that removes all occurrences of the maximum element from a list
