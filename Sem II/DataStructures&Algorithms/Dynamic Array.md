## Regular Arrays
Arrays can hold a *fixed* number of elements of *the same type*, which occupy a *contiguous* memory block.
The address of an array is the address of the first element
We can access elements in *constant time* 

## Dynamic Arrays 
The advantage of dynamic arrays over regular ones is the fact that the size is not set during the declaration (meaning that the size of arrays can grow and shrink)
