The sequence $(x_k)_{k\leq 0}$ having the recurrence $x_{k+2} = x_{k+1}+x_k$ has as many solutions as there are pairs in $\mathbb{R}^2$, since, each pair can be assigned as a pair of initial values for this sequence

Formulation of the IVP for differentiable equations
$x' + ax = 0 \rightarrow x(0) = n$  
$x''+a_1x'+a_2x=0 \rightarrow x(0)=n_1, x'(0) = n_2$
